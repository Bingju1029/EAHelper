# EAHelper
EA Helper Source Code
# PUBLIC NOW


# Why no more crack?
I would continue crack if ea helper public their auto change, and this version actually same as newest version from annoucement (2.6.8)\
And if you guys have beta file or something, send to me, i would trying to crack it, but no more source code, because he wasnt using base64 anymore, might just crack by using inject dll\
also, it doesnt have many updates on normal version, i don't know about beta version, but normal version doesn't have any useful update, just many bugs fix.
